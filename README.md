# ThermoConvert

Simple Java temperature converter that converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Features
- Interactive console menu with conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or newer installed and `javac`/`java` available on your PATH.

## Files
- `Temperature.java`: main program that shows a menu and performs conversions.

## Build and run (Windows PowerShell)
1. Open PowerShell in the project directory (where `Temperature.java` is located).
2. Compile:

```powershell
javac Temperature.java
```

3. Run:

```powershell
java Temperature
```

## Example usage
- After running, choose a menu option number (1-7) then enter the temperature value when prompted.
- Choose `7` to exit.

## Notes
- The program uses simple formulas and prints results to the console.
- There are minor text/capitalization inconsistencies in `Temperature.java` (these do not affect functionality).
